The Automatic target delivers a Java payload using remote class loading. This requires Metasploit to run an HTTP server in addition to the LDAP server that the target can connect to.

First, it detects the correct parameters (Query String Length and custom header length) needed to trigger code execution. This step determines if the target is actually vulnerable (Check method). Then, the exploit sets a series of PHP INI directives to create a file locally on the target, which enables code execution through a query string parameter. This is used to execute normal payload stagers.

The vulnerability was introduced by Debian and Ubuntu Redis packages that insufficiently sanitized the Lua environment. The maintainers failed to disable the package interface, allowing attackers to load arbitrary libraries. On a typical `redis` deployment (not docker), this module achieves execution as the `redis` user. Debian/Ubuntu packages run Redis using systemd with the \"MemoryDenyWriteExecute\" permission, which limits some of what an attacker can do. For example, staged meterpreter will fail when attempting to use mprotect. As such, stageless meterpreter is the preferred payload. Redis can be configured with authentication or not. This module will work with either configuration (provided you provide the correct authentication details). This vulnerability could theoretically be exploited across a few architectures: i386, arm, ppc, etc. However, the module only supports x86_64, which is likely to be the most popular version.",

The kernel pool is groomed so that overflow is well laid-out to overwrite an SMBv1 buffer. Actual RIP hijack is later completed in srvnet!SrvNetWskReceiveComplete. This exploit, like the original may not trigger 100% of the time, and should be run continuously until triggered.

By sending a specially crafted message, an attacker can corrupt the heap and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Exim daemon. The root cause is that no check is made to ensure that the buffer is not full prior to handling '%s' format specifiers within the 'string_vformat' function. In order to trigger this issue, we get our message rejected by sending a message that is too large. This will call into log_write to log rejection headers (which is a default configuration setting). After filling the buffer, a long header string is sent. In a successful attempt, it overwrites the ACL for the 'MAIL FROM' command. By sending a second message, the string we sent will be evaluated with 'expand_string' and arbitrary shell commands can be executed. It is likely that this issue could also be exploited using other techniques such as targeting in-band heap management structures, or perhaps even function pointers stored in the heap. However, these techniques would likely be far more platform specific, more complicated, and less reliable. This bug was original found and reported in December 2008, but was not properly handled as a security issue. Therefore, there was a 2 year lag time between when the issue was fixed and when it was discovered being exploited in the wild. At that point, the issue was assigned a CVE and began being addressed by downstream vendors. An additional vulnerability, CVE-2010-4345, was also used in the attack that led to the discovery of danger of this bug. This bug allows a local user to gain root privileges from the Exim user account. If the Perl interpreter is found on the remote system, this module will automatically exploit the secondary bug as well to get root.",

The clfs.sys driver contains a function CreateLogFile that is used to create open and edit '*.blf' (base log format) files. Inside a .blf file there are multiple blocks of data which contain checksums to verify the integrity of the .blf file and to ensure the file looks and acts like a .blf file. However, these files can be edited with CreateFileA or with fopen and then modified with WriteFile or fwrite respectively in order to change the contents of the file and update their checksums accordingly. This exploit makes use to two different kinds of specially crafted .blf files that are edited using the technique mentioned above. There are multiple spray .blf files. The spray .blf files are specially crafted to initiate an out of bounds read which reads from a contiguous block of memory. The block of memory it reads from contains a read-write pipe that points to the address of the second type of .blf file - the trigger .blf file. The trigger .blf file is specially crafted read the SYSTEM token and write it in the process of the exploit to achieve the local privilege escalation. The exploits creates a controlled memory space by first looping over the CreatePipe function to to create thousands of read-write pipes (which take up 0x90 bytes of memory). It then releases a certain number of pipes from memory and calls CreateLogFile to open the pre-existing spray .blf files which when being opened fill the 0x90 byte gaps created by the deallocation of the pipes in memory, creating the controlled memory space. This is a very brief and high overview description of what the exploit is actually doing.

This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the `Events` feature of Pandora FMS. This flaw allows users to execute arbitrary commands via the `target` parameter in HTTP POST requests to the `Events` function. After authenticating to the target, the module attempts to exploit this flaw by issuing such an HTTP POST request, with the `target` parameter set to contain the payload. If a shell is obtained, the module will try to obtain the local MySQL database password via a simple `grep` command on the plaintext `/var/www/html/pandora_console/include/config.php` file. Valid credentials for a Pandora FMS account are required. The account does not need to have admin privileges.

This module has been tested on Zimbra Collaboration Server 8.0.2 with Ubuntu Server 12.04.",

An attacker can perform a remote command execution by injecting the payload into the `Search Target` (ST) field of the SSDP M-SEARCH discover packet. After successful exploitation, an attacker will have full access with `root` user privileges. NOTE: Staged meterpreter payloads might core dump on the target, so use stage-less meterpreter payloads when using the Linux Dropper target.

The kernel pool is groomed so that overflow is well laid-out to overwrite an SMBv1 buffer. Actual RIP hijack is later completed in srvnet!SrvNetWskReceiveComplete. This exploit, like the original may not trigger 100% of the time, and should be run continuously until triggered. It seems like the pool will get hot streaks and need a cool down period before the shells rain in again. The module will attempt to use Anonymous login, by default, to authenticate to perform the exploit. If the user supplies credentials in the SMBUser, SMBPass, and SMBDomain options it will use those instead. On some systems, this module may cause system instability and crashes, such as a BSOD or a reboot. This may be more likely with some payloads.",

This allows attackers to overwrite it with any arbitrary value, and results code execution. A patch is available at visiwave.com; the fix is done by XORing the return value as null if no match is found, and then it is validated before use. NOTE: During installation, the application will register two file handles, VWS and VWR, which allows a victim user to 'double click' the malicious VWR file and execute code.

The vulnerability is within the \"sreplace\" function within the \"src/support.c\" file. The off-by-one heap overflow bug in the ProFTPD sreplace function has been discovered about 2 (two) years ago by Evgeny Legerov. We tried to exploit this off-by-one bug via MKD command, but failed. We did not work on this bug since then. Actually, there are exists at least two bugs in sreplace function, one is the mentioned off-by-one heap overflow bug the other is a stack-based buffer overflow via 'sstrncpy(dst,src,negative argument)'. We were unable to reach the \"sreplace\" stack bug on ProFTPD 1.2.10 stable version, but the version 1.3.0rc3 introduced some interesting changes, among them: 1. another (integer) overflow in sreplace! 2. now it is possible to reach sreplace stack-based buffer overflow bug via the \"pr_display_file\" function! 3. stupid '.message' file display bug So we decided to choose ProFTPD 1.3.0 as a target for our exploit. To reach the bug, you need to upload a specially created .message file to a writeable directory, then do \"CWD <writeable directory>\" to trigger the invocation of sreplace function. Note that ProFTPD 1.3.0rc3 has introduced a stupid bug: to display '.message' file you also have to upload a file named '250'. ProFTPD 1.3.0 fixes this bug. The exploit is a part of VulnDisco Pack since Dec 2005.",

The first stage bypasses authentication by fixating session cookies. The second stage uses those authenticated sessions cookies to write a file to disk and execute that file as the \"nobody\" user. The third and final stage occurs when the file executed as \"nobody\" writes an entry into the database that causes QRadar to execute a shell script controlled by the attacker as root within the next minute. Details about these vulnerabilities can be found in the advisories listed in References. The Forensics web application is disabled in QRadar Community Edition, but the code still works, so these vulnerabilities can be exploited in all flavours of QRadar. This module was tested with IBM QRadar CE 7.3.0 and 7.3.1. IBM has confirmed versions up to 7.2.8 patch 12 and 7.3.1 patch 3 are vulnerable.

By specifying specific parameters to the new plugin, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. When the new plugin is invoked with a \"launchjnlp\" parameter, it will copy the contents of the \"docbase\" parameter to a stack-buffer using the \"sprintf\" function. A string of 396 bytes is enough to overflow the 256 byte stack buffer and overwrite some local variables as well as the saved return address. NOTE: The string being copied is first passed through the \"WideCharToMultiByte\". Due to this, only characters which have a valid localized multibyte representation are allowed. Invalid characters will be replaced with question marks ('?'). This vulnerability was originally discovered independently by both Stephen Fewer and Berend Jan Wever (SkyLined). Although exhaustive testing hasn't been done, all versions since version 6 Update 10 are believed to be affected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability was patched as part of the October 2010 Oracle Patch release.",

This exploit is executed through the ASA's ASDM web server and lands in the FirePower Services SFR module's Linux virtual machine as the root user. Access to the virtual machine allows the attacker to pivot to the inside network, and access the outside network. Also, the SFR virtual machine is running snort on the traffic flowing through the ASA, so the attacker should have access to this diverted traffic as well. This module requires ASDM credentials in order to traverse the ASDM interface. A similar attack can be performed via Cisco CLI (over SSH), although that isn't implemented here. Finally, it's worth noting that this attack bypasses the affects of the `lockdown-sensor` command (e.g. the virtual machine's bash shell shouldn't be available but this attack makes it available).

The flaw exists due to the fact that this function calls `hdcOpenDCW()`, which performs a user mode callback. During this callback, attackers can call the `NtGdiResetDC()` function again with the same handle as before, which will result in the PDC object that is referenced by this handle being freed. The attacker can then replace the memory referenced by the handle with their own object, before passing execution back to the original `NtGdiResetDC()` call, which will now use the attacker's object without appropriate validation. This can then allow the attacker to manipulate the state of the kernel and, together with additional exploitation techniques, gain code execution as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.

This can be issued by an application to open a handle to an arbitrary process with the necessary privileges to allocate, read and write memory in the specified process. This exploit leverages this vulnerability to open a handle to the winlogon process (which runs as NT_AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM) and infect it by installing a hook to execute attacker controlled shellcode. This hook is then triggered on demand by calling user32!LockWorkStation(), resulting in the attacker's payload being executed with the privileges of the infected winlogon process. In order for the issued IOCTL to work, the RazerIngameEngine.exe process must not be running. This exploit will check if it is, and attempt to kill it as necessary. The vulnerable software can be found here: https://www.razerzone.com/synapse/. No Razer hardware needs to be connected in order to leverage this vulnerability.

Consider using a command execution payload following the bind shell to restart the service if you need to reuse the same port. The overflow appears to occur in the debugging/error reporting section of the slmail.exe executable, and there are multiple offsets that will lead to successful exploitation. This exploit uses 2606, the offset that creates the smallest overall payload. The other offset is 4654. The return address is overwritten with a \"jmp esp\" call from the application library SLMFC.DLL found in %SYSTEM%\\system32\\. This return address works against all version of Windows and service packs. The last modification date on the library is dated 06/02/99. Assuming that the code where the overflow occurs has not changed in some time, prior version of SLMail may also be vulnerable with this exploit.

The vulnerability occurs when parsing specially crafted MIDI files. Remote code execution can be achieved by using the Windows Media Player ActiveX control. Exploitation is done by supplying a specially crafted MIDI file with specific events, causing the offset calculation being higher than what is available on the heap (0x400 allocated by WINMM!winmmAlloc), and then allowing us to either \"inc al\" or \"dec al\" a byte. This can be used to corrupt an array (CImplAry) we setup, and force the browser to confuse types from tagVARIANT objects, which leverages remote code execution under the context of the user. Note: At this time, for IE 8 target, msvcrt ROP is used by default. However, if you know your target's patch level, you may also try the 'MSHTML' advanced option for an info leak based attack. Currently, this module only supports two MSHTML builds: 8.0.6001.18702, which is often seen in a newly installed XP SP3. Or 8.0.6001.19120, which is patch level before the MS12-004 fix.

The SQL injection can be used to achieve remote code execution as SYSTEM in Windows or as the user in Linux. This module exploits both PostgreSQL (newer builds) and MySQL (older or upgraded builds). MySQL targets are more reliable due to the use of relative paths; with PostgreSQL you should find the web root path via other means and specify it with WEB_ROOT. The injection is only exploitable via a GET request, which means that the payload has to be sent in chunks smaller than 8000 characters (URL size limitation). Small payloads and the use of exe-small is recommended, as you can only do between 10 and 20 injections before using up all the available ManagedConnections until the next server restart. This vulnerability exists in all versions released since 2006, however builds below DC v7 70200 and PMP v6 6500 do not ship with a JSP compiler. You can still try your luck using the MySQL targets as a JDK might be installed in the $PATH.",

This flaw was originally identified as CVE-2021-1732 and was patched by Microsoft on February 9th, 2021. In early 2022, a technique to bypass the patch was identified and assigned CVE-2022-21882. The root cause is is the same for both vulnerabilities. This exploit combines the patch bypass with the original exploit to function on a wider range of Windows 10 targets.",

An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to authenticate as an admin user without needing to provide a password, thereby gaining full control of the device. (Whenever an admin logs into My Cloud, a server-side session is created that is bound to the user's IP address. After the session is created, it is possible to call authenticated CGI modules by sending the cookie username=admin in the HTTP request. The invoked CGI will check if a valid session is present and bound to the user's IP address.) It was found that it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to create a valid session without a login. The network_mgr.cgi CGI module contains a command called \"cgi_get_ipv6\" that starts an admin session -- tied to the IP address of the user making the request -- if the additional parameter \"flag\" with the value \"1\" is provided. Subsequent invocation of commands that would normally require admin privileges now succeed if an attacker sets the username=admin cookie.",

The module first performs a check to see if the target is WD MyCloud. If so, it attempts to trigger an authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) via a crafted GET request to /cgi-bin/network_mgr.cgi. If the server responds as expected, the module assesses the vulnerability status by attempting to exploit a commend injection vulnerability (CVE-2016-10108) in order to print a random string via the echo command. This is done via a crafted POST request to /web/google_analytics.php. If the server is vulnerable, the same command injection vector is leveraged to execute the payload. This module has been successfully tested against Western Digital MyCloud version 2.30.183. Note: based on the available disclosures, it seems that the command injection vector (CVE-2016-10108) might be exploitable without the authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) on versions before 2.21.126. The obtained results on 2.30.183 imply that the patch for CVE-2016-10108 did not actually remove the command injection vector, but only prevented unauthenticated access to it.",

Note that spawning a command prompt with the shortcut key combination Win+Shift+# does not work in Vista, so the attacker will have to check if the user is already running a command prompt and set SPAWN_PROMPT false. Three exploit techniques are available with this module. The WEB technique will execute a powershell encoded payload from a Web location. The FILE technique will drop an executable to the file system, set it to medium integrity and execute it. The TYPE technique will attempt to execute a powershell encoded payload directly from the command line, but may take some time to complete.",

It was originally found being exploited in the wild targeting Japanese and Korean IE8 users on Windows XP, around the same time frame as CVE-2013-3893, except this was kept out of the public eye by multiple research companies and the vendor until the October patch release. This issue is a use-after-free vulnerability in CDisplayPointer via the use of a \"onpropertychange\" event handler. To set up the appropriate buggy conditions, we first craft the DOM tree in a specific order, where a CBlockElement comes after the CTextArea element. If we use a select() function for the CTextArea element, two important things will happen: a CDisplayPointer object will be created for CTextArea, and it will also trigger another event called \"onselect\". The \"onselect\" event will allow us to set up for the actual event handler we want to abuse - the \"onpropertychange\" event. Since the CBlockElement is a child of CTextArea, if we do a node swap of CBlockElement in \"onselect\", this will trigger \"onpropertychange\". During \"onpropertychange\" event handling, a free of the CDisplayPointer object can be forced by using an \"Unselect\" (other approaches also apply), but a reference of this freed memory will still be kept by CDoc::ScrollPointerIntoView, specifically after the CDoc::GetLineInfo call, because it is still trying to use that to update CDisplayPointer's position. When this invalid reference arrives in QIClassID, a crash finally occurs due to accessing the freed memory. By controlling this freed memory, it is possible to achieve arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.",

This module has been tested successfully on glibc version 2.11.1 on Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 and version 2.7 on Debian 5.0.4 i386. RHEL 5 is reportedly affected, but untested. Some glibc distributions do not contain the libpcprofile.so library required for successful exploitation.",

This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the `Events` feature of Pandora FMS. This flaw allows users to execute arbitrary commands via the `target` parameter in HTTP POST requests to the `Events` function. After authenticating to the target, the module attempts to exploit this flaw by issuing such an HTTP POST request, with the `target` parameter set to contain the payload. If a shell is obtained, the module will try to obtain the local MySQL database password via a simple `grep` command on the plaintext `/var/www/html/pandora_console/include/config.php` file. Valid credentials for a Pandora FMS account are required. The account does not need to have admin privileges. This module has been successfully tested on Pandora 7.0 NG 744 running on CentOS 7 (the official virtual appliance ISO for this version).",

The PHP file contains an encoded payload that allows for remote command execution on the target server.

The module first uploads the archive via `Import New Language` and then attempts to execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to the PHP file in the root server directory.

When the \"Unix In-Memory\" target is selected, a newer, higher-level, and more universal entry point based on GroovyShell.parse is used.
